### Getting Started


#### Downloading OpenTx Companion

OpenTx Companion 2.1 is available for download at http://www.open-tx.org/downloads.html

This is major version with completely new telemetry handling. Please read [this thread](http://www.openrcforums.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=45&t=7239) before upgrading from a previous version, and carefully check the changelogs on each upgrade. This branch is the first to support the FrSky Taranis X9E (tray version).


#### Updating firmware with Lua option selected
