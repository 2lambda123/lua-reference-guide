## getValue(source)



Returns the value of a source. 

The list of valid sources is available:
* for OpenTX 2.0.x at http://downloads-20.open-tx.org/firmware/lua_fields.txt
* for OpenTX 2.1.x at http://downloads-21.open-tx.org/firmware/lua_fields.txt

In OpenTX 2.1.x the telemetry sources no longer have a predefined name. 
To get a telemetry value simply use its sensor name. For example:
 * Altitude sensor has a name "Alt"
 * to get the current altitude use the source "Alt"
 * to get the minimum altitude use the source "Alt-", to get the maximum use "Alt+"

@status current Introduced in 2.0.0, changed in 2.1.0


#### Parameters

* `source`  can be an identifier (number) (which was obtained by the getFieldInfo())
or a name (string) of the source.



#### Return value

* `value` current source value (number). Zero is returned for:
 * non-existing sources
 * for all telemetry source when the telemetry stream is not received

* `table` GPS position is returned in a table:
 * `lat` latitude, positive is North (number)
 * `lon` longitude, positive is East (number)

* `table` GPS date/time is returned in a table, format is the same 
as is returned from getDateTime()

* `table` Cells are returned in a table 
(except where no cells were detected in which 
case the returned value is 0):
 * table has one item for each detected cell
 * each item name is the cell number (1 to number of cells)
 * each item value is the current cell voltage



##### Notice
Getting a value by its numerical identifier is faster then by its name.
