# One-Time Scripts

####Overview

One-Time scripts start when called upon by a specific radio function or when the user selects them from a contextual menu. They do their task and are then terminated and unloaded. Please note that all persistent scripts are halted during the execution of one time scripts. They are automatically restarted once the one
time script is finished. This is done to provide enough system resources to execute the one time script.
