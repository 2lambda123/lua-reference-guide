### Getting Started


#### Downloading OpenTX Companion

OpenTX Companion 2.1 is available for download at http://www.open-tx.org/downloads.html

This is major version with completely new telemetry handling. Please read [this thread](http://www.openrcforums.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=45&t=7239) before upgrading from a previous version, and carefully check the changelogs on each upgrade. This branch is the first to support the FrSky Taranis X9E (tray version).


#### Updating firmware with Lua option selected

When updating the firmware on your transmitter, be sure the lua option is checked in the settings for your radio profile (Main menu -> Settings ->Settings...) as shown below.

Also note that the SD Structure path should contain a valid path to a copy of your transmitter's SD card contents.
